So... 

I discovered GitHub Learning Lab and used one of their tutorials to create a portfolio using GitHub Pages. Some standard ass shit. But here is the [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) if you are just as noob as I am.

There is nothing interesting on the portfolio now though, I will come back and add more fun stuff.

Thanx!
